# OAuth2 Implementation Example

This is an example implementation of OAuth2 in Go using Gorilla Mux and JWT for token management. This implementation
includes the basic components of OAuth2, such as authentication, authorization, and token generation. Here's a brief
overview of the project structure and functionality:

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: The main entry point of the application that sets up the HTTP server and defines the main routing logic.

- `authentication.go`: Handles user authentication and issues an authentication token (JWT) upon successful login.

- `authorization.go`: Manages authorization and generates an authorization code that clients can use to request an
  access token.

- `token.go`: Contains functions to validate JWT tokens and generate access tokens for authorized clients.

- `response.go`: A utility for creating JSON responses with error handling.

## Usage

- Start the server by running main.go.

- Access the /login route to initiate the authentication process. Users are prompted to enter their username and
  password.

- Upon successful authentication, an authentication token (JWT) is generated and stored as a cookie.

- Users can access the /authorize route to authorize a client application to access their resources. The user must be
  logged in to access this route.

- After authorization, an authorization code is generated and passed to the client's callback URL.

- The client can then exchange the authorization code for an access token by making a GET request to the /token route
  with the code.

## Configuration

- User credentials and client details are stored in memory for simplicity. In a production environment, these should be
  stored securely, such as in a database.

- The JWT secret key (secretKey) should be kept secret and stored securely. In a real-world scenario, you would likely
  use a more complex and secure key management solution.

## Security Considerations

- This example provides a basic OAuth2 flow for demonstration purposes. In a production system, you must implement
  additional security measures, such as HTTPS, user session management, and secure storage of secrets.

- Ensure that you follow best practices for securing user credentials, access tokens, and authorization codes.

- Implement rate limiting and other security measures to prevent abuse.

## Dependencies

- Gorilla Mux: A powerful HTTP router and URL matcher for building Go web applications.

- jwt-go: JSON Web Token (JWT) library for Go.

## Disclaimer

This is a simplified example meant for educational purposes. In a real-world scenario, you should use a dedicated OAuth2
library and adhere to OAuth2 standards and best practices.

Feel free to enhance and adapt this example to your specific use case and security requirements.
